summary: 'Jim Drain of 4J Drain Construction, Inc. says that Yodle is the complete package. &#8220;The adversite is very professional, it&#8217;s terrific,&#8221; Jim said. He also loves how easy it is to upload photos from his cell phone to the dashboard which automatically synchs with Facebook, directories and his adversite.'
transcript: "My name is Jim Drain and I'm president of 4J Drain Construction Incorporated. We now have a professional marketing team working for us to provide us with the sales leads we need in order to be successful. When you consider the services that are provided, you couldn't possibly hire anybody to provide the level of professional services that Yodle does for the cost. Whenever I have a question I'm in touch with people and they give me complete and total support, so it's a very complete package of services that they provide. \r\n\tThe adversite was put together by Yodle very quickly and very professionally. It describes what we do across the board. It really is terrific. I was then uploading my leads. Soon we got on Google&#8482; and then a little later, Bing&#8482;. It's very easy to upload pictures from your cellphone or from a camera. We quickly transfer that with no problems at all and of course a picture is worth a thousand words. Getting those pictures into the adversite is simple and is very, very beneficial. \r\n\tInquiries began coming in and once you have inquiries that you can qualify and turn into sales, I think 10 real leads out of the 23 calls that we got and to make three sales out of that. Again, 30% is a high number. In our business that one sale can be a $10,000 sale or a $100,000 sale. So, it's really exciting to have people call who are in need of a general contractor. \r\n"

blockquote: 'Yodle has really helped us compete with larger businesses and get our name out there.'
summary: 'Denna Green is a broker and part owner at Earnest Walker Realty in Texas. She realized that doing her own marketing on Facebook wasn&#8217;t enough to keep up with the competition that was growing in her small town. With Yodle, Denna went from struggling to get her name out there to competing with the big guys using a comprehensive marketing strategy.'
transcript: "I'm Denna Green and we have Walker Realty in Corsicana County, Texas. We are a small independent real estate firm. Our biggest marketing challenge was getting our name out there. We had to compete with the bigger franchises and Yodle has helped us do that.\r\n\tWe've been here since 1977 but newcomers to town had never heard of Walker Realty so this has helped us get our name out there. Our Yodle experience so far has been really good. It's given us the ability to come up first whenever people do a Google search. I like to be able to go in and click on the contact name and send the buyers and sellers reviews and there's not a lot of steps involved, it's very user friendly. \r\n\tAfter a transaction, it gives them the ability to go in and leave feedback and comments which is all posted on Facebook so that's really helped us a lot. When we close on a property with someone, we take a picture with that agent that sold the property with the buyer or the seller and upload it and then it goes to Facebook immediately.\r\n\tIt was so easy, Yodle did everything, all we had to do was enter names and pictures and it was just they made it very, very easy. I feel like we'll continue to use Yodle in the future because what it's doing is working for us. I would tell other businesses to try Yodle because it really is helpful when you're trying to compete with larger businesses. It's not that expensive in the grand scheme of things and you get a lot of bang for your buck."
