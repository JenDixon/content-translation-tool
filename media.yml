blockquote: 'We have had more work this year than we have ever had because of Yodle.'
summary: 'Rich Whittington, manager at Pappas Landcare and Construction, tried other marketing services that didn’t meet his expectations. Rich heard about Yodle through a friend and decided to sign up. Since then the company has had more work than ever before. They also love the seamless and synchronized way the Marketing Essentials™ features perform.'
transcript: "Hi. My name is Rich Whittington. I'm currently the manager of Pappas Landcare and Construction. Before we signed up with Yodle, our biggest marketing challenge was that the advertisement companies in which we were utilizing weren't living up to their expectations in which we were hoping for.\r\n\tWe decided to sign up with Yodle because one of our friends that are in the same type of industry was utilizing Yodle, so we thought it was worth taking a shot to see what they're about. Whenever you have money that has to be invested, you're always going to have skepticism, but they made us feel that our investment was worth looking into and that our money is well-invested into something that is going to potentially help our company grow.\r\n\tThe sales presentation was done very professionally. They broke down what services they offered so that we understood what we were getting ourselves into. Our experience with Yodle has been nothing but positive. Right now, our work force has been extremely busy. We have had more work this year than we have ever had in the past eight years that I've worked for Pappas Landcare and Construction.\r\n\tBy utilizing the upload function, it allows me to upload images to our Adversite that are more current and also allows us to upload images to Facebook, so we tackle two services with one stone. For any small business owner out there, the hardest part of maintaining a successful business is having the work come in. By allowing Yodle to do that function for you and to actually take the time to get the work to come in, it allows you to have more time in doing the professional services that you offer.\r\n"
